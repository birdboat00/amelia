# What is amelia?

> Amelia is still very young and heavily work-in-progress so a lot of stuff might change.

Amelia is an open-source creative-coding toolkit for modern JavaScript.

It is meant to be a simple and functional collection of API's to rapidly create
good looking sketches. It puts an emphasis on the following aspects:

- **lightweight** - at the moment ~50kb in size
- **functional** - simple and easy to use function style API with a lot of
  functionality
- **fast** - tries to be as fast as possible by being a thin wrapper around the
  2D Canvas API

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/birdboat00/amelia). There
is also a gallery of examples that you can find [here](../examples/).
